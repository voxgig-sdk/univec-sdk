    cache = { active = true },
    clienttrack = { active = true },
    cost = { active = true },
    debug = { active = true },
    idempotency = { active = true },

    streaming = { active = true },
    telemetry = { active = true },
    test = { active = true },
    timeout = { active = true },
  },
})
```


### Configuring features

Each feature is inactive until switched on, and an SDK with no feature
configured does no feature work at all. Every option below keeps its default
unless you name it.

The array form of \`feature\` is significant: several features wrap the
transport, and the order you list them in is the order they nest.

#### Ordering

`cache`, `cost`, `netsim`, `proxy`, `ratelimit`, `retry`, `secrets`, `timeout` wrap the transport. Each
wraps whatever is already installed, so **activation order is nesting order**:
a feature activated later sits OUTSIDE one activated earlier, and sees the call
first.

That decides behaviour, not just sequence. \`cost\` activated before \`cache\`
sits inside it, so a response served from the cache never reaches \`cost\` and is
correctly charged nothing; reverse them and every cache hit is billed for money
that was never spent.

`audit`, `clienttrack`, `debug`, `idempotency`, `log`, `metrics`, `paging`, `rbac`, `streaming`, `telemetry`, `test` attach to pipeline hooks
rather than the transport, so their order does not affect what they observe.

#### `audit`

Structured audit trail of operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `actor` | `'anonymous'` |
| `max` | `1000` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.audit.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `cache`

Response caching for safe read requests.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `max` | `256` |
| `methods` | `['GET']` |

Options above are those the model carries a default for. A feature may
also accept callback options — a `sink` to receive each record, for
instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.cache.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Wraps the transport: its place in the activation order decides what it
  sees. See [Ordering](#ordering) above.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

#### `clienttrack`

Client identity and per-request correlation headers.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |

instance — which have no default and are covered in the full feature
reference.

**Usage**

Set `feature.clienttrack.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

  not change what it observes.
