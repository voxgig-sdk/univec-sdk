require_once __DIR__ . '/univec_sdk.php';

$client = new UnivecSDK($options);
```

Create a new SDK client instance.

**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$options` | `array` | SDK configuration options. |
| `$options["apikey"]` | `string` | API key for authentication. |
| `$options["base"]` | `string` | Base URL for API requests. |
| `$options["prefix"]` | `string` | URL prefix appended after base. |
| `$options["suffix"]` | `string` | URL suffix appended after path. |
| `$options["headers"]` | `array` | Custom headers for all requests. |
| `$options["feature"]` | `array` | Feature configuration. |
| `$options["system"]` | `array` | System overrides (e.g. custom fetch). |


### Static Methods

#### `UnivecSDK::test($testopts = null, $sdkopts = null)`

Create a test client with mock features active. Both arguments may be `null`.

```php
$client = UnivecSDK::test();
```


### Instance Methods

#### `Convert($data = null)`

Create a new `ConvertEntity` instance. Pass `null` for no initial data.

#### `Embed($data = null)`

Create a new `EmbedEntity` instance. Pass `null` for no initial data.

#### `EphemeralKey($data = null)`

Create a new `EphemeralKeyEntity` instance. Pass `null` for no initial data.

#### `Model($data = null)`

Create a new `ModelEntity` instance. Pass `null` for no initial data.

#### `options_map(): array`

Return a deep copy of the current SDK options.

#### `get_utility(): UnivecUtility`

Return a copy of the SDK utility object.

#### `direct(array $fetchargs = []): array`

Make a direct HTTP request to any API endpoint. This is the raw-HTTP escape
hatch: it does **not** throw. It returns a result array
`["ok" => bool, "status" => int, "headers" => array, "data" => mixed]`, or
`["ok" => false, "err" => \Exception]` on failure. Branch on `$result["ok"]`.

**Parameters:**

| --- | --- | --- |
| `$fetchargs["path"]` | `string` | URL path with optional `{param}` placeholders. |
| `$fetchargs["method"]` | `string` | HTTP method (default: `"GET"`). |
| `$fetchargs["params"]` | `array` | Path parameter values for `{param}` substitution. |
| `$fetchargs["query"]` | `array` | Query string parameters. |
| `$fetchargs["headers"]` | `array` | Request headers (merged with defaults). |
| `$fetchargs["body"]` | `mixed` | Request body (arrays are JSON-serialized). |
| `$fetchargs["ctrl"]` | `array` | Control options. |

**Returns:** `array` — the result dict (see above); never throws.

#### `prepare(array $fetchargs = []): mixed`

Prepare a fetch definition without sending the request. Returns the
`$fetchdef` array. Throws on error.

    "clienttrack" => ["active" => true],
    "cost" => ["active" => true],
    "debug" => ["active" => true],
    "idempotency" => ["active" => true],

    "telemetry" => ["active" => true],
    "test" => ["active" => true],
    "timeout" => ["active" => true],
  ],
]);
```


### Configuring features

Each feature is inactive until switched on, and an SDK with no feature
configured does no feature work at all. Every option below keeps its default
unless you name it.

The array form of `feature` is significant: several features wrap the
transport, and the order you list them in is the order they nest.

#### Ordering

`cache`, `cost`, `netsim`, `proxy`, `ratelimit`, `retry`, `timeout` wrap the transport. Each
wraps whatever is already installed, so **activation order is nesting order**:
a feature activated later sits OUTSIDE one activated earlier, and sees the call
first.

That decides behaviour, not just sequence. `cost` activated before `cache`
sits inside it, so a response served from the cache never reaches `cost` and is
correctly charged nothing; reverse them and every cache hit is billed for money
that was never spent.

`audit`, `clienttrack`, `debug`, `idempotency`, `log`, `metrics`, `paging`, `rbac`, `streaming`, `telemetry`, `test` attach to pipeline hooks
rather than the transport, so their order does not affect what they observe.

#### `audit`

Structured audit trail of operations.

**Configuration**

| Option | Default |
|---|---|
| `active` | `false` |
| `actor` | `'anonymous'` |
| `max` | `1000` |

**Usage**

Set `feature.audit.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.

**Considerations**

- Attaches to pipeline hooks, not the transport, so activation order does
  not change what it observes.
- Inactive by default: leaving it out costs nothing at runtime.

**Usage**

Set `feature.cache.active` to true in the client options, and override any option above in the same entry. Every option keeps
its default unless you name it.
